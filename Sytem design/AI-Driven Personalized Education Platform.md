2. Student watches videos, completes quizzes, and interacts on forum.
3. User events stream through Kafka → used to update recommendation models.
4. Performance tracking flags students who may need tutoring.
5. Chatbot answers FAQs or provides personalized explanations.
6. Teachers view dashboards with student progress & intervention suggestions.
