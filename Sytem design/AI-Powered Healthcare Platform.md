## 11. **Sample User Flow**

1. Patient wears IoT device → streams heart rate & glucose → data ingested via Kafka.
2. Data stored in MongoDB; anomaly detection model flags irregularities.
3. Patient uploads retina photo → AI diagnostics service runs CNN model, returns risk score.
4. Doctor views risk & history on web portal; uses chatbot assistant powered by ClinicalBERT.
5. Treatment recommender suggests personalized meds based on knowledge graph.
6. Telemedicine session initiated using WebRTC.
7. All data securely logged and monitored with audit trails.
